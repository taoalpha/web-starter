## Web Starter

This is a self-use starter. You can use if you want, start from the todomvc under the example folder.

```
" pull and run:
npm install && npm start
```

### Modules

- Front-end Framework: react
- Module Manager: webpack
- Dev Server: webpack-dev-server (express)


More details please see package.json and webpack.config.js

### examples

Currently I have built two examples for this starter:

- TodoMVC: the classic todo app from [todomvc](http://todomvc.com), basically the same as the one in [redux repo](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc);
- FlowState: a dangerous writing app, let you focus on writing, [origin product - flowstate](http://hailoverman.com/flowstate)

Just replace the `example` in `package.json` and then run `npm start`, you can see the result on your browsers.

Also, you can see the demo from the github pages: [flowstate](http://taoalpha.me/web-starter/flowstate/) and [todomvc](http://taoalpha.me/web-starter/todo/)
